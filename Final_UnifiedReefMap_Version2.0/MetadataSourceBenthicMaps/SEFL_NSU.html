The SE FL benthic habitats were mapped using the same combined technique approach as described in Walker, Riegl, and Dodge (2008).  Image-based analyses in deeper water were not ideal due to poor water clarity; therefore, a high resolution (4 m) LIDAR bathymetric survey was conducted to image the sea floor. This was conducted in two phases. Phase 1, where a LIDAR bathymetric survey of the seafloor was conducted and Phase 2 where habitat maps were created by outlining and defining the features within the bathymetric survey. Southeast Florida benthic habitat maps were produced by delineating seafloor features evident in multiple datasets including the 2001 Broward Lidar, 2002 Palm Beach and Miami-Dade lidar, 2005 FWC Biscayne aerial photography, 2006 USACE coastal lidar, and 2008 and 2009 FWC Martin lidar bathymetry and aerial photography. This dataset is the combination of all previous regional mapping efforts by Dr. Brian Walker at Nova Southeastern University. The habitats were classified according to established NOAA guidelines in coordination with the NOS Coral Mapping Program and use a similar classification scheme when possible. A spatial analysis of the habitat maps helped defined six coral reef ecosystem regions based on Walker (2012) and Walker and Gilliam (in review). Since the distribution of many marine species relates to certain habitats and depth regimes, mapping data provide valuable information in the absence of detailed ecological data that can be used to identify and spatially quantify smaller scale (10 s km) coral reef ecosystem regions and potential physical biogeographic barriers. GIS spatial analyses were conducted on the habitat maps to identify and quantify specific regions along the coast that were statistically distinct in the number and amount of major benthic habitat types.
